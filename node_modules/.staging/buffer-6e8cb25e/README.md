With [browserify](http://browserify.org), simply `require('buffer')` or use the `Buffer` global and you will get this module.

The goal is to provide an API that is 100% identical to
[node's Buffer API](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html). Read the
[official docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) for the full list of properties,
instance methods, and class methods that are supported.

## features

- Manipulate binary data like a boss, in all browsers -- even IE6!
- Super fast. Backed by Typed Arrays (`Uint8Array`/`ArrayBuffer`, not `Object`)
- Extremely small bundle size (**5.04KB minified + gzipped**, 35.5KB with comments)
- Excellent browser support (IE 6+, Chrome 4+, Firefox 3+, Safari 5.1+, Opera 11+, iOS, etc.)
- Preserves Node API exactly, with one minor difference (see below)
- Square-bracket `buf[4]` notation works, even in old browsers like IE6!
- Does not modify any browser prototypes or put anything on `window`
- Comprehensive test suite (including all buffer tests from node.js core)


## install

To use this module directly (without browserify), install it:

```bash
npm install buffer
```

This module was previously called **native-buffer-browserify**, but please use **buffer**
from now on.

A standalone bundle is available [here](https://wzrd.in/standalone/buffer), for non-browserify users.


## usage

The module's API is identical to node's `Buffer` API. Read the
[official docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) for the full list of properties,
instance methods, and class methods that are supported.

As mentioned above, `require('buffer')` or use the `Buffer` global with
[browserify](http://browserify.org) and this module will automatically be included
in your bundle. Almost any npm module will work in the browser, even if it assumes that
the node `Buffer` API will be available.

To depend on this module explicitly (without browserify), require it like this:

```js
var Buffer = require('buffer/').Buffer  // note: the trailing slash is important!
```

To require this module explicitly, use `require('buffer/')` which tells the node.js module
lookup algorithm (also used by browserify) to use the **npm module** named `buffer`
instead of the **node.js core** module named `buffer`!


## how does it work?

The Buffer constructor returns instances of `Uint8Array` that have their prototype
changed to `Buffer.prototype`. Furthermore, `Buffer` is a subclass of `Uint8Array`,
so the returned instances will have all the node `Buffer` methods and the
`Uint8Array` methods. Square bracket notation works as expected -- it returns a
single octet.

The `Uint8Array` prototype remains unmodified.


## one minor difference

#### In old browsers, `buf.slice()` does not modify parent buffer's memory

If you only support modern browsers (specifically, those with typed array support),
then this issue does not affect you. If you support super old browsers, then read on.

In node, the `slice()` method returns a new `Buffer` that shares underlying memory
with the original Buffer. When you modify one buffer, you modify the other.
[Read more.](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_slice_start_end)

In browsers with typed array support, this `Buffer` implementation supports this
behavior. In browsers without typed arrays, an alternate buffer implementation is
used that is based on `Object` which has no mechanism to point separate
`Buffer`s to the same underlying slab of memory.

You can see which browser versions lack typed array support
[here](https://github.com/feross/buffer/blob/master/index.js#L22-L48).


## tracking the latest node api

This module tracks the Buffer API in the latest (unstable) version of node.js. The Buffer
API is considered **stable** in the
[node stability index](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index),
so it is unlikely that there will ever be breaking changes.
Nonetheless, when/if the Buffer API changes in node, this module's API will change
accordingly.

## performance

See perf tests in `/perf`.

`BrowserBuffer` is the browser `buffer` module (this repo). `Uint8Array` is included as a
sanity check (since `BrowserBuffer` uses `Uint8Array` under the hood, `Uint8Array` will
always be at least a bit faster). Finally, `NodeBuffer` is the node.js buffer module,
which is included to compare against.

NOTE: Performance has improved since these benchmarks were taken. PR welcoem to update the README.
